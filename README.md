# applied_stat_covid

## Context

This repository is a project that I did during my Master 1 at ENSAE Paris.

The name of the course was "Group of applied statistics" and took place between November 2022 and May 2023.

We were a group of 3 and we passed this course with 17.5/20.

## Objectives

We were supervised by Laurent Davezies from CREST (Center for Research in Economics & Statistics).

In this project, we tried to use a statistical framework to a demographic problematic : over-mortality caused by Covid-19.

We only focused on what happened in France in 2020.

## How to go through our project

Our whole study is available in the PDF document.

The notebooks that are present in this repository contain the application of our statistical methodology.
- population : we import and clean population databases
- observed_mortality_ratios : we import, clean and transform databases to retrieve observed mortality ratios
- predicted_mortality_ratios : we transform dataframes to obtain predicted mortality ratios
- predicted_number_of_deaths : we predict the number of deaths in 2020 in France

## Disclaimer

It was one of our first time using Python and the main objective was really the theoretical part, so the code one is not really clean.

Hope you enjoy your read !
